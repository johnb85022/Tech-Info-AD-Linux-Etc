Date from ansible , ansible_date_time to see all formats, etc. 
---
- name: display date
  hosts: dnshosteast001
  tasks:
    - debug: var=ansible_date_time.iso8601

Use find to look at the proc pid tables , this example the VmSawp size used. 
find /proc/*/status -exec cat {} \; |grep -e '^Pid:' -e VmSwap

Handy use of grep , are the two files the same ? Note the order of the file names really changes things. 
grep -vFxf yesterday.txt today.txt 

Use file yesterday as the point of ref, the regeg to seek in the today file, in a way showing what has been added in to the
today set. 
grep -vFxf yesterday.txt today.txt

What file and what line number we are talking about, the -n and -H are handy when debuging grep options. 
grep -nHvFxf yesterday.txt today.txt

If I flip the files, then I can see what has been dropped from today. 
grep -vFxf today.txt yesterday.txt

Handy tcpdumps I like.
Good Web ref for tcpdump 
https://danielmiessler.com/study/tcpdump/

Examaple of filtering out stuff. -c helps to stop it if I forget.
tcpdump '( (not arp) and (not port 22) and ( not port 68) )' -c 99999

Can help us to see details of the protocols. 
tcpdump '( (not arp) and (not port 22) and ( not port 68) )' -vv 

Will try to open the packets and show us ASCCI 
tcpdump '( (not arp) and (not port 22) and ( not port 68) )' -vv -A 

Simple this one IP to watch the flows. 
tcpdump -vv -i ens128 'host 10.10.10.10'
