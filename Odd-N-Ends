Handy use of grep , are the two files the same ? Note the order of the file names really changes things. 
grep -vFxf yesterday.txt today.txt 

Use file yesterday as the point of ref, the regeg to seek in the today file, in a way showing what has been added in to the
today set. 
grep -vFxf yesterday.txt today.txt

What file and what line number we are talking about, the -n and -H are handy when debuging grep options. 
grep -nHvFxf yesterday.txt today.txt

If I flip the files, then I can see what has been dropped from today. 
grep -vFxf today.txt yesterday.txt
