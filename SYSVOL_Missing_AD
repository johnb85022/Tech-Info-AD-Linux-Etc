SYSVOL share missing from a AD DC server. 
Run net share to look for it. 

NETLOGON is not a folder, it is a share in the SYSVOL directory tree.

 

SYSVOL is a directory on a DC server that is shared and is kept in SYNC . The content of the sysvol is a lot of domain and GOP stuff. An update to a GOP for example will be written to a disk, then the DFS will replicates the files and directories around. 

OK one event we did see when the syslog was missing, was “too old message” , over 60 some days , believe this was a root cause event. 

The NEW DC was added ok, The AD sync tools said a-ok, BUT , the NETLOGON and SYSVOL share where missing. 

Use the command “net share” to check and see the DC shares. Should see the SYSVOL AND the NETLOGON, the netlogon is a directory in the sysvol, so it is a dependent of the sysvol. 


1)	OK how to kick start the SYSVOL share , if its not sharing from the DC. 
Edit the registry key to kick it, ON the DC where it is not working, 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters
Change the value to sysvolready=1

The value might be set to zero, a zero will stop the sysvol.
The netlog is under under the sysvol, BUT it is controlled by the NETLOGON service. 

2)	Now kick start the DRFR SYSVOL so the DC can bring the files in from other DC systems.

Open adsi edit, edit the value, be sure to push apply. Read the editor path from the OU=Domain Controllers down.

DC=domain,DC=local > OU=Domain Controllers > CN=(DC NAME) > CN=DFSR-LocalSettings > Domain System Volume > SYSVOL Subscription

Change the value to false. This will stop the SYSVOL DSRF. 
msDFSR-Enabled = FALSE

Sync the AD so the other DC see the update. 
Repadmin /syncall /Adp 

Run the command to push the update of the state of the SYSVOL DFSR.
dfsrdiag pollad 

If you want to see the DSRF add the console. 
Add-WindowsFeature RSAT-DFS-Mgmt-Con

Event ID 4114 should be in the event log, this is the SYSVOL repl disabled event. 

Count to 30. 

Reenable the SYSVOL DSRF sync. 

Open adsi edit, edit the value, be sure to push apply. Read the editor path from the OU=Domain Controllers down.

DC=domain,DC=local > OU=Domain Controllers > CN=(DC NAME) > CN=DFSR-LocalSettings > Domain System Volume > SYSVOL Subscription

Change the value to false. This will stop the SYSVOL DSRF. 
msDFSR-Enabled = TRUE

Sync the AD so the other DC see the update. 
Repadmin /syncall /Adp 

Run the command to push the update of the state of the SYSVOL DFSR.
dfsrdiag pollad 

Event ID 4614 and 4604 should be in the event log now. These are the DFSR sync events. 

3)	Kick start the NETLOGON folder, Stop and Start the NETLOGON service.

QA steps.
See if the folder is getting files.
See if the share is sharing , net share.
dcdiag /v /c /d /e > myfile.txt
READ THE FILE, will have a lot of info, need all the options so can we
see any funky stuff. 
Repadmin /kcc , watch for funky stuff. 

Other handy AD commands.
dcdiag /test:connectivity
repadmin /kcc
REPADMIN /SHOWREPS
REPADMIN /REPLSUM
repadmin /showrepl DC_SERVER_NAME
repadmin /syncall DC_SERVER_NAME /AeD
dcdiag /v /c /d /e
dsquery server  

Check IP settings on all the AD servers.
Look out for funky DNS Ip6 Address names to the AD servers that might be in the AD.

Ensure the following dns setting on DC:
1. Each DC / DNS server points to its private IP address as primary DNS server and other remote/local DNS servers as secondary in TCP/IP properties.
2. Each DC has just one IP address and single network adapter is enabled.
3. Contact your ISP and get valid DNS IPs from them and add it in to the forwarders, Do not set public DNS server in TCP/IP setting of DC.
4. Once you are done, run "ipconfig /flushdns & ipconfig /registerdns", restart DNS and NETLOGON service each DC.
Do not put private DNS IP addresses in forwarder list.
5.Assigning static IP address to DC if IP address is assigned by DHCP server to DC.It is strongly not recommended
